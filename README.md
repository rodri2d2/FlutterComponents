# FlutterComponents

As part of become a senior mobile developer I decided to cover properly two parts of a full stack.

iOS is still my main goal and of course I am working hard on it.
However I decided also to take Flutter on a different level. I understood how practical it could be to help me or my clients get the required MVP and decide the feasibility of the project. And also it is sooo fun!!!

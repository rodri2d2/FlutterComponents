Dart
    Use "_" when you want to be a file private function, vars or objects
    Some kind of array object you can go back into and keeps adding.
    e.g.:
        List<int> list = [];
        list.add(1);
        list.add(2);

        The code below works the same way

        list..add(1)
            ..add(2)

    Dart has map function



Flutter

    The easiest way to insert an icon on Flutter is to use Icon() class.
    e.g.:
        Icon( Icons.add )
        Icons comme from material icons https://fonts.google.com/icons

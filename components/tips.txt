Dart
    Use "_" when you want to be a file private function, vars or objects
    Some kind of array object you can go back into and keeps adding.
    e.g.:
        List<int> list = [];
        list.add(1);
        list.add(2);

        The code below works the same way

        list..add(1)
            ..add(2)

    Dart has map function



Flutter

    The easiest way to insert an icon on Flutter is to use Icon() class.
    e.g.:
        Icon( Icons.add )
        Icons comme from material icons https://fonts.google.com/icons

    When inserts a new static file PUBSPEC.YAML have to be notified. There is a assets tab.
    Use the commented exemple on assests to understand how to import self assets. After should update and
    full reload of the app

    Use Column and Row to stack "views" and one direction or another
    Both classes has an element childrem [], which demands a array of Widgets

    When use FadeImage first of all load both static and maybe a NetworkImage before any other property on the constructor

    Class Container() will has the same with and height of item inside it

    barrierDismissible property allows to dismiss a AlertDialog by clicking outside the box
